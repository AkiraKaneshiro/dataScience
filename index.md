title: Tools, Tips and Tricks for Data Science
tagline: 
---

This is a website dedicated to bringing together tips, tricks, and tools for data science. I focus on command line tools and two programming languages [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org). Before we begin, I am working on tutorials for learning e.g. [Python](http://www.stephaniehicks.com/learnPython/) that I suggest to work through if you are not familiar with the programming languages.  

When analyzing a set of data, the tasks will be (generally) broken up into the following categories: 

1. Scraping data (from web or API)
2. Data cleaning, wrangling, munging, transforming, reshaping, carpentry etc. 
3. Exploratory data analysis (e.g. histograms, scatterplots, boxplots)
4. Applying models
5. Creating beautiful graphics and summaries of the analysis

There are many good data science courses available (for example the [Open Source Data Science Masters](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go) and [Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization Course](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1)). This is a collection of tools, tips/tricks, articles and resources that I have collected.  In each section, I give examples of relevant tools from each of the command line, R and Python. This is definitely a work in progress and is mostly a way for me to keep track of useful things in the analysis of data. My hope is others will find it useful too.
